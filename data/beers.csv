"tmEthz","""Admiral"" Stache","""Admiral"" Stache (2012)","Milwaukee Brewing Co’s take on a classic European style. Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The “Admiral” Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.    We first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as “Shake Down Nut Brown”. You can guess what went wrong from there… But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.    We use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.","7","23","4","5","37","104","N","2012","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/tmEthz/upload_3Jl1St-icon.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/tmEthz/upload_3Jl1St-medium.png","https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/tmEthz/upload_3Jl1St-large.png","verified","Verified","","","1.071","2012-09-09 13:35:27","2015-12-16 18:47:43","4","Seasonal","Available at the same time of year, every year.","5","Pint","2012-01-03 02:41:33","37","37","3F0708","104","9","9","Other Lager","2012-03-21 20:06:46","Baltic-Style Porter","Baltic Porter","A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance.

Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels.

Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","9","20","2.8","3.5","8","17","1.03","1.006","1.012","2012-03-21 20:06:45","2015-04-07 15:19:41"

Having just returned from a blueberry pollination in Maine and looking to sell off some of his honey we jumped on close to 200 lbs of this liquid gold and added it to the brown ale during secondary fermentation. Also added to the Disco funk tank was a blend of yeast, one a Belgian Saison Yeast and the other, our buddy Brettanomyces (aka Brett).
