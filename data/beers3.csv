Ten different hops: Horizon, Chinook, Columbus, Willamette, Tradition, Northern Brewer, Santiam, Tettnanger, Cascade and Golding, in the order of their use -- give Ten Squared a unique hop character which has to be tasted to be believed.

Even with 100 IBUs, this brew sports a strong malt backbone. Two-row Pale, Caramel 40, Caramel 75, Special B and Aromatic malts impart remarkable balance for such a hop monster. This is smooth ale with surprising similarities to ten year old malt whiskey.",10,100,5,,4,34,N,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-icon.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-medium.png,https://s3.amazonaws.com/brewerydbapi/beer/Ml1FV3/upload_FAbrWH-large.png,verified,Verified,,,2012-01-03 02:42:36,2015-12-15 23:35:33,5,Pint,2012-01-03 02:41:33,,,,4,Seasonal,"Available at the same time of year, every year.",34,3,3,North American Origin Ales,2012-03-21 20:06:45,American-Style Barley Wine Ale,American Barleywine,"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness. Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",60,100,8.4,12,11,22,1.09,1.024,1.028,2012-03-21 20:06:46,2015-04-07 15:27:08,,

A roasted malt character which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels.

Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived.
