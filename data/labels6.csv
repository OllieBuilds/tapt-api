LTW1iI,369’ Stout,369’ Stout,"Our 369′ Stout takes its name from Flathead Lake itself – its deepest point. It was developed after our award-winning Mutiny Stout. Creamy, malty, and full-bodied with a hint of crisp bitterness. Sometimes served on Nitro, making it creamier and more full-bodied. Oats, caramel, chocolate, and roasted malts give our Stout its deep, dark color and pronounced roasted flavor. Montana grown 2-row pale, caramel, chocolate, oats, and roasted barley malts. Simcoe and Cascade hops.

Brewers Gabe Fletcher of Midnight Sun Brewing Company [Anchorage, AK] and Colby Chandler of Ballast Point Brewing Company [San Diego, CA] designed and brewed an exciting representation of their passions: hops, Belgian yeast, oak aging and Brettanomyces.

Just prior to the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Fest in JAN 2009, Gabe and Colby brewed a West Coast-worthy IPA at Midnight Sun Brewing Company. This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors. During its course to completion, 3767 was affected by three different yeast strains--including Brettanomyces, aged for several months in French oak Cabernet Sauvignon barrels, and then bottle- and keg-conditioned.

The plan is for 3767 to hit Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and San Diego in NOV 2009 for a West Coast Toast. Here’s to the collaborative spirit readily found in our brewing industry.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.

Their recipe pays tribute to the Pabst Brewing Company’s Ballantine IPA that Jeff first tasted in 1974.  Our favorite description for this beer comes from Beer Advocate:  “It is not polite. Its flavors are almost defiant- a huge nose with hops and malt struggling for control, a bit of oak, just the right carbonation and an insanely long finish worthy of any hop-head.”
In recognition of their contribution to a crowd-funding campaign at our Ypsilanti Microbrewery location, one of the perks extended to the Rankerts was the opportunity to stop by the brewery and brew the recipe of their choosing.
